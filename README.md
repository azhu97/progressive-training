# Progressive Training

**Work in Progress** 🚧

This project is a full-stack workout tracker and recommendation app. Users can register, log in, log their workouts, and receive personalized workout recommendations. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB; the frontend uses React and Vite.

## Current Status
- User authentication (register/login) is implemented
- Workouts can be logged and retrieved
- Simple recommendation logic is in place
- Frontend has basic auth and dashboard UI

**Note:** This project is still under active development. Features, UI, and logic are being improved and expanded. Expect bugs and incomplete functionality.

## Setup
See `client/README.md` and `server/README.md` for setup instructions for each part.

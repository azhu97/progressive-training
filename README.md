# Progressive Training

**Work in Progress** 🚧

This project is a full-stack workout tracker and recommendation app. Users can register, log in, log their workouts, and receive personalized workout recommendations. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB; the frontend uses React and Vite.

## Current Status
- User authentication (register/login) is implemented
- Workouts can be logged and retrieved
- Simple recommendation logic is in place
- Frontend has basic auth and dashboard UI

**Note:** This project is still under active development. Features, UI, and logic are being improved and expanded. Expect bugs and incomplete functionality.

## Setup
See `client/README.md` and `server/README.md` for setup instructions for each part.

### Workouts

- `GET /api/workouts` - Get all workouts for user
- `POST /api/workouts` - Create new workout
- `GET /api/workouts/:id` - Get specific workout with exercises
- `DELETE /api/workouts/:id` - Delete workout

### Exercises

- `POST /api/workouts/:id/exercises` - Add exercise to workout
- `DELETE /api/exercises/:id` - Delete exercise

### Statistics

- `GET /api/stats` - Get workout statistics

## Features in Detail

### Dashboard

## Database Schema

### Users

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `username` (Unique)
- `password` (Hashed)
- `created_at`

### Workouts

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key)
- `name`
- `date`
- `notes`

### Exercises

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `workout_id` (Foreign Key)

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the backend server (port 6060) with hot reloading.

### Database Management

```bash
# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npm run prisma:studio

# Generate Prisma client
npm run prisma:generate

# Push schema changes to database
npm run prisma:push

# Create and apply migrations
npm run prisma:migrate
```

### Running Backend Only

```bash
npm run server
```

### Running Frontend Only

```bash
npm run client
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Security Features

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token authentication
- SQL injection protection
- CORS configuration
- Input validation

## Customization

### Adding New Exercise Types

You can easily add predefined exercise types by modifying the exercise form in `WorkoutDetail.js`.

### Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS. You can customize the design by modifying:

- `client/src/index.css` - Global styles
- `client/src/App.css` - Component-specific styles
- `client/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration

### Database

The application uses SQLite with Prisma ORM for type safety and better database management. For production, you can easily switch to PostgreSQL or MySQL by updating the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file and changing the provider in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**

   - Change the port in `server/index.js` (line 8)
   - Update the proxy in `client/package.json`

2. **Database errors**

   - Delete the `gym.db` file and restart the server
   - The database will be recreated automatically

3. **CORS errors**
   - Ensure the backend is running on port 5000
   - Check the proxy configuration in `client/package.json`
